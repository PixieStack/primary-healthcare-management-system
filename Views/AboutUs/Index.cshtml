                <h2>What is the Primary Healthcare System?</h2>
                <p>
                    The primary healthcare system is a web-based platform developed to
                    address the lack of accessibility and affordability of healthcare
                    services in many communities. It aims to provide convenient and
                    cost-effective healthcare services to a wider population. The system
                    aims to address the problem of limited access to quality health care
                    services, particularly for vulnerable populations such as pregnant
                    women, children, and individuals with chronic illnesses in rural
                    areas/townships where people may have to travel long distances to
                    access health facilities. As well as addressing the challenge of
                    limited access to quality health care services in the community. The
                    web-based system will provide patients with easy access to health care
                    services from the comfort of their homes or local clinics, while also
                    improving efficiency and reducing waiting times.

                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>The primary healthcare system will be developed as a web-based platform using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MVC. The platform will be hosted on a secure server to ensure the privacy and security of patient data. The vaccination subsystem will be integrated into the platform, allowing healthcare providers to schedule and manage vaccination appointments for patients. The system will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible to users with different levels of technical expertise. The platform will be developed using a responsive design approach, ensuring that it can be accessed from a variety of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones.</p>

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Our project aims to develop a digital healthcare management system that can facilitate the management of patients, medical records, appointments, and medication for hospitals and clinics. The system will be designed to provide an easy-to-use interface that can be accessed by healthcare providers, patients, and administrators. With the increasing demand for healthcare services and the need to streamline healthcare processes, our project will offer an efficient and effective solution that can help healthcare providers deliver high-quality care.</p>

                <h2>Issue Statement</h2>
                <p>The current healthcare management system is largely paper-based and manual, leading to inefficiencies in managing patient data, scheduling appointments, and managing medications. This system is prone to errors and can lead to delays in patient care, missed appointments, and medication errors. In addition, the lack of a centralized database makes it difficult to share patient information between healthcare providers, leading to suboptimal care.</p>
